# Blaster (v0.1)

## Note

Please note that this game is currently in development, and so is limited in terms of features.

## About

This is an early version of a space shooter game which I have made using Python using the Pygame library. You control a spaceship, and can shoot lasers to destroy incoming meteors.

## Future updates

Here are some of the features I plan to add to this game:

  - More weapons

  - Enemies that shoot
  - Particles
  - And much more
